# Basic-Programming-Quiz
A very basic programming quiz using Javascript

Sure you've taken a multiple choice quiz before, so I shouldn't have to explain how it works :P. This program consists of 5 questions and each question is worth 1 point. The total will be tallied at the very end. 

The questions consist of math, binary and javascript questions.

Good luck!

This program was built and ran on Sublime, but any text editor should be able to run it. Simply open it to the browser by right clicking on your text editor using the HTML page.
